## Introduction

Assistive technology is a device, software, or system that helps individuals with disabilities perform functions that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. Therefore, we developed "narrAIte," an assistive technology designed to support and benefit blind people. This innovation aims to enhance accessibility and provide a more inclusive experience, particularly for individuals with visual impairments, by utilizing technology to address their unique needs.

## Project Overview

narrAite automatically creates and narrates stories based on visual inputs by combining text-to-speech and image recognition technology. This enables blind youngsters to interact meaningfully with visual content by converting still images into dynamic audio narratives. It shows how artificial intelligence may be used to develop inclusive digital solutions that provide people with disabilities more authority.

## Objectives

- Develop a solution for [Blind Inclusivity].
- Implement features to [make a story that can be understand by impaired].
- Test and validate [Image to Speech].

## Features

- Accessible: Account is not needed.
- Free Resources: Collections Tab offers series of photos that the user can use.
- Audible: Crafted Stories can be heard loud and clear.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, TailwindCSS
- Frameworks/Libraries: React, FastAPI
- Databases: Firebase Storage
- Other Tools: MistralAI, CoquiTTS, gTTS
